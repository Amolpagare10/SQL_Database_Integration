# ðŸ“Š SQL Database Integration
## ðŸš€ About the Project

This project showcases my work during my **first-year summer internship**, where I explored and implemented **SQL Database Integration Learning Modules** using **MySQL Workbench**. The primary goal of this project was to gain a hands-on understanding of how relational databases work and curate easy-to-understand learning material for the company.  

Throughout the internship, I focused on essential database concepts and made available to the company in the form of learning modules.
